# GenSpectrum components

## Storybook

We use Storybook to develop our components.

To start Storybook, run:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Then, open http://localhost:6006/ in your browser.

## Testing

We use vitest to run our unit tests.

To run tests, run:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Example usage

To see the components in action, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start a server at http://localhost:5173/ that shows the components that are used in
`index.html`.
