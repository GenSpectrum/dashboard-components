# Size of components

All visualization and input components can be provided with a width prop (or height, when applicable) to control the size of the component.
If not provided, the default width or height is used. In most cases, the default is a width of '100%' of its parent container and a predefined height.

Both width and height can be set using the css units (e.g. 'px', 'em', 'rem', '%', 'vh', 'vw', etc.).
By using '%', the size of the component can be controlled by the parent component.

Caution: When using '%' as a unit, the parent component should have a defined width or height.
