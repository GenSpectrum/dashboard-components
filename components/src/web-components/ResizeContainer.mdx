# Size of components

All visualization and input components can be provided with a width prop (or height, when applicable) to control the size of the component.
If the width is not provided, the default is used. In most cases, the default is a width of '100%' of its parent container.
If the height is not set, the component takes up as much space as needed in the vertical direction.
For table views, this includes showing the complete table.
For diagrams, a fixed aspect ratio of 2:1 (width/height) is used.

Both width and height can be set using the css units (e.g. 'px', 'em', 'rem', '%', 'vh', 'vw', etc.).
By using '%', the size of the component can be controlled by the parent component.

Caution: When using '%' as a unit, the parent component should have a defined width or height.
