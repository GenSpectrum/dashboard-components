# Introduction

The components in this section let the user specify values for LAPIS filters.
The filters can then be used as input to the visualization components.

Every component fires `CustomEvent`s when the user interacts with it, which can be used to update the LAPIS filters.
The `detail` of the event is designed such that it can be directly passed to the LAPIS API.
