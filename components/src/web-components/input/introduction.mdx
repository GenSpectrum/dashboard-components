# Introduction

The components in this section let the user specify values for LAPIS filters.
The filters can then be used as input to the visualization components.

Every component fires `CustomEvent`s when the user interacts with it.
`event.detail` contains the payload of the event.

Every component fires an event that can be used to update the LAPIS filters.
It is supposed to be used in the style of:

```javascript
component.addEventListener('gs-example-event', (event) => {
    setNewLapisFilter({
        ...previousLapisFilter,
        ...event.detail,
    });
});
```

## Controlled Input Components

HTML input components can be controlled or uncontrolled.
In a controlled component, the value is controlled by surrounding Javascript code.
In an uncontrolled component, the value is controlled by the DOM and the surrounding Javascript code only reads the value
(e.g. by listening to events).

All our input components can be used in both ways.
Every component fires one or two events.
If the event details can be used to update the LAPIS filter
_and_ the value then the component will only fire one event,
otherwise it will fire one event to update the LAPIS filter and one to update the value of the component.
Refer to the documentation of the individual components for details on which event you can use for which purpose.

**Example**: A controlled input component in a React app could conceptually look like this:

```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const ExampleInput = () => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState('foo');
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        if (!inputRef.current) {
            return;
        }

        const eventListener = (event) => {
            setValue(event.detail);
        };

        inputRef.current.addEventListener('gs-input', eventListener);

        return () => {
            inputRef.current.removeEventListener('gs-input', eventListener);
        };
    }, []);

    return <gs-example-input ref={inputRef} value={value} />;
};
```
