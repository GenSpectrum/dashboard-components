# Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis

## Scales

On most plots, users can select the y-axis scaling through a dropdown.
They can choose between linear, logarithmic and logistic scaling.
By default, it is set to a linear scale.

In general, for each scale the displayed height of a value is calculated by applying the corresponding scale function.

- Linear: `value`
- Logarithmic: `ln(value)`
- Logistic: `ln(value / (1 - value))`

## Confidence Intervals

On bar and line plots, users can choose to display confidence intervals.
For line plots, this is done by shading the area between the upper and lower bounds.
For bar plots, this is done by adding error bars to the top of each bar.

Currently, only one method is available for calculating the confidence intervals:
the [wilson score interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval) with a confidence level of 95%.
