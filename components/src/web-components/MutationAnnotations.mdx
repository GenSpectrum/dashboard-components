# Mutation Annotations

Organism data usually has a lot of mutations.
It can be challenging for users to find out which mutations are relevant to investigate.
To guide the user to the most interesting mutations, we provide a mutation annotation feature.

The mutation annotations can be (optionally) supplied to `gs-app` as a JSON object:

```html
<gs-app
    lapis="https://your.lapis.url"
    mutationAnnotations="[
        {
            name: 'I am an annotation!',
            description: 'This describes what is special about these mutations.',
            symbol: '+',
            nucleotideMutations: ['C44T', 'C774T', 'G24872T', 'T23011-'],
            aminoAcidMutations: ['S:501Y', 'S:S31-', 'ORF1a:S4286C'],
        },
    ]"
>
    {/* children... */}
</gs-app>
```

The mutation annotations are then distributed to child components.
Whenever we display a mutation (e.g. in the `gs-mutations` table view)
we will append the `symbol` of all matching annotations: <span>C44T<sup class='text-red-600'>+</sup></span>.
Users can click on the mutation to open a modal that shows the `name` and `description` of the annotation.
