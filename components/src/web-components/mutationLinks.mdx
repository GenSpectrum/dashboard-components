# External Mutation Links

When inspecting mutations, you might want to be able to quickly look up a mutation somewhere else.
For this, it's possible to supply a _link template_ which will then lead to mutation labels being clickable using
that link template.

The mutation link template can be (optionally) supplied to `gs-app` as a JSON object:

```html
<gs-app
    lapis="https://your.lapis.url"
    mutationLinkTemplate='{
        "nucleotideMutation": "https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Switzerland/AllSamples/Past6M/variants?nucMutations={{mutation}}",
        "aminoAcidMutation": "https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Switzerland/AllSamples/Past6M/variants?aaMutations={{mutation}}",
    }'
>
    {/* children... */}
</gs-app>
```

For example (like in the code above) you can directly link to cov-spectrum.

Your link needs to have the placeholder `{{mutation}}` in it, which will then be replaced with the mutation code.
